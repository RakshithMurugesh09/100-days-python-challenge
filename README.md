## 📌 About This Repository

This repository documents my **Python learning journey** following a  
**100-Day Python Learning Roadmap**.

I am learning Python by:
- Studying concepts daily
- Implementing them through **mini projects**
- Using **ChatGPT as a teacher** for:
  - Concept explanations
  - Code templates (not full solutions)
  - Code review & feedback
- Aligning learning with **Dr. Angela Yu’s structured curriculum**

This repository focuses on **learning, clarity, and best practices**, not shortcuts.

## 🧠 Learning Methodology

For **each day**, the following structure is strictly followed:

### 🔹 PART 1: Concept Explanation
- Simple, beginner-friendly explanations
- What the concept means
- Why it is used
- Where it is useful in real life
- 1–2 small examples only (no project-level code)

### 🔹 PART 2: Mini Project Overview
- What the project does
- What problem it solves
- Expected output (sample text)
- Concepts applied from Part 1

### 🔹 PART 3: Code Template Only
- ❌ No complete solutions
- ✅ Only skeleton code
- Uses:
  - Functions
  - Comments
  - TODO markers
- No shortcuts or hard-coded logic

### 🔹 PART 4: Code Review
After I submit my code:
- ChatGPT reviews correctness
- Rates the solution out of 10
- Suggests improvements (no full rewrite)
- Confirms readiness to move to the next day
